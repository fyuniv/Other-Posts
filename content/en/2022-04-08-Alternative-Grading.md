Academic honesty has been a major challenge of online learning since the
pandemic. No matter how hard we try with the trandiational grading
system, there doesn't seem a satisfied solution. To address the problem,
it's better to consider alternative grading systems (see Robert
Talbert's blog post "[How specifications grading changed my view of
academic
dishonesty](https://rtalbert.org/how-specifications-grading-changed-my-view-of-academic-dishonesty/)").
In recent years, multiple alternative grading systems, such as
[specifications grading, standard-based
grading](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/01/19/new-ways-grade-more-effectively-essay),
[mastery grading](https://rtalbert.org/tag/mastery-grading/),
[ungrading](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2017/11/14/significant-learning-benefits-getting-rid-grades-essay),
have been widely adapted aiming at motivating student learning with
explicitly designed practice supported by constructive feedback.

The following resourcesmay be helpful to learn and adapt a alternating
grading system.
